# Package 08 Review

## Summary of Key Points
- This package presents a series of programming challenges, possibly designed to deepen understanding of modular arithmetic and other Java programming concepts.
- **Major Functions and Concepts**:
  - `Challenge01.java`, `Challenge02.java`, `Challenge03.java`: These files represent distinct programming challenges. While the specific tasks aren't described here, they likely focus on applying Java programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and possibly modular arithmetic, as suggested by the presence of a similarly named file to one in a previous package.
  - `ModularMath.java`: This file might be related to or the same as the one in the previous package, focusing on modular arithmetic operations, which are essential for many algorithmic challenges.

## Discussion Points
- The importance of engaging with programming challenges to improve problem-solving skills and deepen understanding of programming concepts.
- Strategies for approaching algorithmic problems, including breaking down the problem, understanding requirements, and planning before coding.
- Sharing approaches and solutions among team members to foster collaborative learning and diverse problem-solving techniques.

## Questions for Team Discussion
1. What specific programming concepts do we anticipate these challenges to cover, and how can we prepare or review these concepts beforehand?
2. How can we effectively organize a group session to work through these challenges, ensuring everyone participates and learns?
3. Are there particular strategies or tools that we find helpful when tackling programming problems, which we can share with the team?

## Action Items
- **[Team Member Name]**: Take the lead in organizing a coding session to work through `Challenge01.java`, preparing any necessary background materials or resources.
- **[Team Member Name]**: Develop a brief guide or checklist on problem-solving strategies that can be applied to these challenges, to be shared with the team.
- **[Team Member Name]**: Propose a system for team members to share their solutions and explanations for `Challenge02.java` and `Challenge03.java`, fostering a collaborative learning environment.
