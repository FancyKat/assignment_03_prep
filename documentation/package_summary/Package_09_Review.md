# Package 09 Review

## Summary of Key Points
- This package is focused on the utilization of methods in Java, showcasing how to define, call, and use methods to organize and modularize code effectively.
- **Major Functions and Concepts**:
  - `Method.java`, `Method01.java`, `Method02.java`, `Method03.java`: These files likely introduce method basics, including definitions, parameters, return types, and calling conventions.
  - `MethodDemo.java`: A demonstration of methods in action, possibly providing examples of various method functionalities and their practical applications.
  - `Increment.java`: Could illustrate the use of methods for incrementing values or demonstrate the concept of method invocation affecting program state.
  - `LoopsVsMethods.java`, `LoopsVsMethods02.java`: A comparison between using loops and methods for achieving similar tasks, highlighting the benefits of modularization and code reuse.
  - `TestReturnGradeMethod.java`: An example of using methods to process data and return results, in this case, possibly converting numerical scores to letter grades.

## Discussion Points
- The advantages of using methods for code modularization, readability, and reuse across different parts of a project.
- Best practices for defining and using methods, including naming conventions, parameter passing, and return values.
- The comparison of iterative (loops) versus method-based solutions for common programming tasks and the scenarios in which one might be preferred over the other.

## Questions for Team Discussion
1. How can we refactor existing code in our project to use methods more effectively, enhancing modularity and readability?
2. What are some examples of repetitive tasks in our project that could be encapsulated in methods for better code organization and reuse?
3. In what situations would it be more efficient to use loops directly, and when should we opt for method-based solutions?

## Action Items
- **[Team Member Name]**: Identify sections of our project code that could be refactored into methods for improved clarity and efficiency.
- **[Team Member Name]**: Create a small tutorial or code review session focused on best practices for method usage, drawing examples from `MethodDemo.java` and related files.
- **[Team Member Name]**: Conduct a comparison study using examples from `LoopsVsMethods.java` and `LoopsVsMethods02.java` to illustrate the decision-making process between using loops and methods.
