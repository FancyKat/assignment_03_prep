# Package 14 Review

## Summary of Key Points
- This package delves into the concepts of data types and object-oriented programming in Java, providing examples through custom classes such as `Person` and `Student`.
- **Major Files and Concepts**:
  - `DataTypeObject00.java` through `DataTypeObject11.java`: A series that likely covers various aspects of data types in Java, including primitives, object references, and possibly the boxing and unboxing of types.
  - `Person.java`, `Student.java`: Define custom classes to represent people and students, illustrating Java's class structure, fields, methods, constructors, and possibly inheritance if `Student` extends `Person`.
  - `StudentDriver.java`, `StudentClient.java`: These files are expected to demonstrate how to create instances of the `Student` class, interact with its fields and methods, and possibly how to manage collections of `Student` objects.
  - `MyDayAtPreschool2DArray08.java`: This file, also seen in previous packages, might be used here to demonstrate how custom objects can be stored and manipulated within two-dimensional arrays.

## Discussion Points
- The importance of understanding both primitive and reference data types in Java for effective class design and object manipulation.
- Best practices for defining and using custom classes in Java, including encapsulation, constructor overloading, and method definition.
- The role of custom objects like `Person` and `Student` in real-world applications, emphasizing how object-oriented programming principles apply to problem-solving.

## Questions for Team Discussion
1. How can we leverage the concepts demonstrated in the `DataTypeObject` series to enhance our understanding and use of data types in our projects?
2. What are some of the key considerations when designing classes like `Person` and `Student` in terms of functionality, data encapsulation, and extensibility?
3. In what ways can the techniques shown in `StudentDriver.java` and `StudentClient.java` be applied to our own project's data management and user interaction features?

## Action Items
- **[Team Member Name]**: Review and present the `DataTypeObject` series, highlighting key learnings and potential applications within our project.
- **[Team Member Name]**: Analyze the design of `Person.java` and `Student.java` to propose enhancements or additional features that could benefit our project.
- **[Team Member Name]**: Organize a coding workshop focusing on the practical application of custom objects and arrays in solving complex programming challenges, using `MyDayAtPreschool2DArray08.java` as an example.
