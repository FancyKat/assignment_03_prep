# Package 03 Review

## Summary of Key Points
- This package delves into conditional statements in Java, alongside continuing themes of user interaction and basic computations.
- **Major Functions**:
  - `IfOneWay.java`, `IfTwoWay.java`, `IfMultipleWay.java`: Different implementations of conditional logic, from simple if statements to more complex if-else structures.
  - `ComputeArea.java`, `ComputeAverage.java`: Basic mathematical computations, reinforcing the use of variables and user input.
  - `UserQA.java`: Engages the user in a question and answer session, highlighting conditional logic based on user responses.
  - `SpecialCharacters.java`, `BackwardSlash.java`, `Carriage.java`: Demonstrates handling special characters in Java, likely focusing on string manipulation or output formatting.
  - `Variable.java`: Introduces variable declarations, types, and basic operations in Java.

## Discussion Points
- The application of conditional statements in programming logic and decision-making processes.
- Best practices for user input validation using conditional statements.
- The significance of understanding and using special characters in output formatting and string manipulation.

## Questions for Team Discussion
1. How can the conditional logic demonstrated in `IfOneWay.java`, `IfTwoWay.java`, and `IfMultipleWay.java` be applied to enhance our project's functionality or user experience?
2. What strategies can we derive from `UserQA.java` for improving interaction with our application's users?
3. In what ways can we incorporate the lessons from `SpecialCharacters.java`, `BackwardSlash.java`, and `Carriage.java` into our project's output and data processing?

## Action Items
- **[Team Member Name]**: Investigate applying the conditional logic patterns from this package to a specific feature of our project.
- **[Team Member Name]**: Prototype an improved user interaction model based on the `UserQA.java` example, tailored to our project's needs.
- **[Team Member Name]**: Create a mini-guide on using special characters for our project's documentation or UI, inspired by the examples in this package.
