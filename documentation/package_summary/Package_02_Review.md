# Package 02 Review

## Summary of Key Points
- This package introduces basic programming concepts through Java applications, including mathematical computations, user input handling, and error demonstrations.
- **Major Functions**:
  - `ComputeArea.java`, `ComputeAreaWithConsoleInput.java`: Calculate areas, introducing variables and console input.
  - `ComputeAverage.java`: Demonstrates how to compute averages based on user inputs.
  - `ComputeLoan.java`: A simple application to calculate loan payments.
  - `FahrenheitToCelsius.java`: Converts temperature units from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
  - `SalesTax.java`: Calculates sales tax for a given amount.
  - `ShowCurrentTime.java`, `DisplayTime.java`: Display the current time in different formats.
  - `UserQA.java`: Engages users in a Q&A session, showcasing simple user interaction.
  - `HelloWorldString.java`, `IntroToProgramming.java`: Basic introductory programs to Java programming.
  - `ComputeChange.java`: Breaks down an amount into smaller denominations.
  - `SpecialCharacters.java`, `Coloring.java`: Demonstrates the use of special characters and basic text coloring in console output.
  - Error Demonstration Files: `ShowSyntaxErrors.java`, `ShowLogicErrors.java`, `ShowRuntimeErrors.java` - These files are likely designed to teach debugging by illustrating common types of errors in programming.

## Discussion Points
- The importance of mastering basic programming concepts and their practical applications.
- Strategies for effectively teaching and learning programming through hands-on examples.
- The role of error demonstration files in understanding and resolving programming errors.

## Questions for Team Discussion
1. How can we apply the mathematical computation examples (`ComputeArea.java`, `ComputeLoan.java`, etc.) in our project's context?
2. What lessons can be learned from the error demonstration files to improve our coding practices?
3. Are there innovative ways to extend the user interaction example (`UserQA.java`) for more complex applications?

## Action Items
- **[Team Member Name]**: Explore extending `ComputeAreaWithConsoleInput.java` for other geometric shapes relevant to our project.
- **[Team Member Name]**: Develop a guideline based on `ShowSyntaxErrors.java`, `ShowLogicErrors.java`, `ShowRuntimeErrors.java` for common debugging practices in our project.
- **[Team Member Name]**: Propose an enhancement to `UserQA.java` for a more interactive user experience that could be applicable to our project.
