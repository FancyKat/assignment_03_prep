# Project Q&A Log

## Overview

This document serves as a centralized log for all questions raised by team members throughout the project, along with the corresponding answers and explanations provided. It aims to facilitate knowledge sharing, reduce repeated inquiries, and ensure clarity on project-related matters.

## Log Format

Each entry in the Q&A log should include the date the question was asked, the name of the person who asked the question, the question itself, the answer provided, and the name of the person who provided the answer. If the question was discussed during a meeting, include the meeting date.

- **Clarity**: Ensure questions are stated clearly and answers are comprehensive and understandable.
- **Verification**: Answers should be verified for accuracy before being added to the log.

## Review and Updates

The Q&A log should be reviewed regularly by the project team to ensure that all information remains current and correct. Updates should be made as new information becomes available or as corrections are needed.
